user_description: I am a Software Engineer talented in developing and readying web applications for deployment. I have always enjoyed and worked with computers, even from a young age, including building my own media server that I manage. I can problem-solve when needed and know how to get to the core of an issue. From working solo to working with a team, I always strive to have an open mind on how to get to the end goal. If you hire me, I can guarantee I will always have an understanding of the newest and best technologies available that make web development more efficient.
